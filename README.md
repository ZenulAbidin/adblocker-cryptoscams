Filter list for cryptocurrency scam websites, pages, and app downloads

ScamWhammer is a filter list for adblockers containing a nearly-exhaustive list of domains being used for scams and HYIPs. The list is not limited to domain names and also contains Telegram links, Medium pages, Youtube videos, and other social engineering and phishing pages. For maximum effectiveness it should be imported into your adblocker of choice, though I intend to get this filter included in adblockers by default.

There are thousands of scammers in the bitcoin universe and very frequently, like highwaymen, they prey on newbies who have no prior knowledge to the legitimacy of the site they are using. A new person in this ecosystem does not know that things like bitcoin generators are actually fake and are snare traps in disguise. We could continue preaching to avoid similar-looking sites to them when someone comes forward with a scam accusation, but some people need an additional hand to guide them what are scams and what is real. Because this is a tiring procedure for mentors I decided to offload the work to the adblocker.

When you visit one of these sites with this filter list, the adblocker will display a prominent page announcing that the site has been blocked. The exact page shown depends on the adblocker you are using, but generally, the name of the filter list should be there, which is aptly named "NotATether's Cryptocurrency Scams List (ScamWhammer)".

This list doesn't only include bitcoin scams but it also includes scams related to other altcoins.
